# Chat sentiment API

This API has the aim to analyze chats and recommend users that have similar 'sentiment' value.  
It's also deployed in heroku https://chat-sentiment-jgph91.herokuapp.com/   

The database is in Atlas MongoDB (cloud) and it contains 3 collections: users, chats and messages. The chats are analyzed using NLTK and the recommend system was developed using a similarities matrix which relates each user using its euclidean distances.
